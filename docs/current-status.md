# ProxyFlow Autonomous Development Status

Updated: 2026-08-17

## Stable Main

- Repository: `kure29/ProxyFlow`
- Stable release: `v0.7.0`
- `origin/main`: `28c1329e1720541b17bd28ab9534ae089e6d4558`
- Product Direction PR #9 is merged.

## Integration

- Integration branch: `autopilot/v1`
- Current milestone: V0.8 - Strategy & Routing Core
- Current slice: Slice E - Diagnostics and compatibility summary
- Working milestone branch: `autopilot/v0.8`
- Original Slice A branch: `feat/v0.8-strategy-routing`
- Original Slice A commit: `bad3e5ab37a8958026cb47f89ac6720f3edf2cd5`
- Integrated Slice A commit: `0fb00f3` (`feat: harden strategy and routing semantics`)

## Completed

- V0.7.0 Subscription Lifecycle release
- Accepted Product Direction and V0.8 Scope Freeze
- Slice A typed matcher, routing validation, deterministic ordering, Rule Set
  references, DIRECT/REJECT/Strategy targets, target lowering, diagnostics, and tests
- Slice B unified the user-facing Routing Rule entry while preserving legacy
  `routing-group`, `service-rule`, and `custom-rule` Project nodes. Basic Service,
  Domain, CIDR, and Port matchers now share one Inspector; ASN, GeoIP, GeoSite,
  Rule Set, and numeric priority remain Advanced. Visible rule order is deterministic
  and can be moved without changing Project Schema 2.
- Slice C refined Strategy UX: Manual, Auto, and Failover are Basic entries;
  Load Balance is Advanced and target-specific, with candidate and empty-source
  explanations. Checkpoint `659591f` is pushed to `origin/autopilot/v0.8`.
- Slice A integrated onto the Product Direction main baseline without rewriting the
  original branch

## In Progress

- Slice E is complete locally and ready for its checkpoint commit. Preview now
  checks both target compilers and shows per-target Supported, warning, blocked,
  loading, or unavailable status while preserving target-specific fail-closed output.

## Next

1. Commit and push the completed Slice E checkpoint.
2. Run official Mihomo and sing-box binary validation where binaries are available.
3. Open `autopilot/v0.8 -> autopilot/v1`, review it, and merge only after all gates pass.

## Latest Validation

- `npm test`: 369/369 passed after Slice D acceptance fixtures
- `npm run build`: passed
- `git diff --check`: passed
- Browser QA: cold English and Chinese library/Inspector flows passed; Basic and
  Advanced strategy groups render correctly, empty candidates are explained,
  and the fresh-tab browser error/warning logs are empty
- Slice D acceptance: Graph -> IR -> Mihomo/sing-box Strategy, DIRECT, REJECT,
  Default Route, and target-specific Failover cases passed
- Slice E browser QA: cold blank project preview showed both Mihomo and sing-box
  as Supported in Chinese; sing-box preview generated JSON and fresh-tab logs
  remained free of errors and warnings
- Vite initial chunk: ~817.69 kB, known `>500 kB` warning
- Original Slice A PR #10: Draft, CI green, not merged

## Known Blockers

- None.

## Known Non-Blockers

- A prior subscription hydration timing fluctuation was not reproduced in three
  consecutive suites or the integration validation. It remains a V1.0 stability audit item.
- A duplicate `strategy` key and transient i18n HMR error appeared only in an
  earlier hot-reload session; neither reproduced in a fresh cold browser tab.
- The initial Vite bundle warning remains a V1.0 performance task.
- TopBar and Preview version copy still reflects V0.6 and is deferred to RC consistency work.

## Deferred

- Full Route Inspector: V0.9
- Optional self-hosted Runtime Service: V0.10
- Third output target and broad protocol expansion: V1.x
- Public backend deployment, multi-user SaaS, billing, plugins, AI, cloud sync: out of scope

## Open Pull Requests

- PR #10: `feat/v0.8-strategy-routing -> main`, Draft, original Slice A checkpoint.
  Do not merge it during autonomous integration.

## Last Checkpoint

- `659591f` on `autopilot/v0.8` (Slice C)
- Slice D acceptance files are the current uncommitted checkpoint.
